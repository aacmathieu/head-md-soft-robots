# Context
For today's exercise we will be working on moving from context to interactions. Students will use a textbot to explore their ideas, and then prototype from this conversation.

## Synthesis
The first goal is to synthesize the previous week's context into a short, simplified textual description. A [template](context.md) has been created to help the students formulating their synthesis.

## Template
- [context.md](context.md)

## Talk To A Robot
Using this text excerpt, students will begin discussion with a textbot of their choice:

- [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com)
- [Claude](https://claude.ai)
- [Hugging Chat](https://huggingface.co/chat/)
- [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/app)
- â€¦

After introductory niceties explaing to the bot their task, they will copy/paste the above synthesis.

## Gestures & Interactions
Dicussions with the bot should cover the following topics:

- Gestures
- One key interaction
- Input
- Output
- Scenario

Students can also discuss:

- Agency
- Context
- Feedback loop
- Why

## Prototype
Based on this conversation, students will create quick physical prototypes using paper, cardboard, straws, balloons, tapes, whatever.
