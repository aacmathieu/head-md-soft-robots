# Context
For today's exercise we will be working on moving from context to interactions. Students will use a textbot to explore their ideas, and then prototype from this conversation.

## Synthesis
The first goal is to synthesize the previous week's context into a short, simplified textual description. A [template](context.md) has been created to help the students formulating their synthesis. This synthesis should describe your context and what you learned from your observations. It does not describe the future interactions, nor the form of your device/experience.

## Template
- [context.md](context.md)

## Talk To A Robot
Using this text excerpt, students will begin discussion with a textbot of their choice:

- [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com)
- [Claude](https://claude.ai)
- [Hugging Chat](https://huggingface.co/chat/)
- [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/app)
- â€¦

After introductory niceties explaing to the bot their task, they will copy/paste the above synthesis.

## Gestures & Interactions
Dicussions with the bot should cover the following topics:

- Gestures
- One key interaction
- Input
- Output
- ~~Scenario~~

Students can also discuss:

- Agency
- Personality
- Context
- Feedback loop
- Why

## Prototype
Based on this conversation, students will create quick physical prototypes using paper, cardboard, straws, balloons, tapes, whatever.
